## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I wanted to create different page for mobile and for pc's so I used display: none for everything and created new content in html.
I am sure there are better ways to do it but I am still proud about my idea :D

That was my second project with JS, so although it was easy still I feel satisfied after iv done this site :D 

### Continued development

I will focus on doing a lot of JS right now until I will be good at basics, then ill get to react 

### Useful resources

I used a lot of Wes-Bos tutorials.
